//Pseudocode
If number has only one digit, it’s a palindrome.
Otherwise, compare the first and last digits.
If they’re different, return false.
If they’re the same, remove those digits and call the function again on what’s left.

//Computational Complexity
The time complexity of the recursive function would be O(d). Where d is the number of digits in the number. 
Each recursive call removes two digits, first and last. This makes it so the number of calls grows roughly linearly with the number of digits.
